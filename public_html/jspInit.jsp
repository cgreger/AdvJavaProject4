    <h2>Concept Name</h2>
        jspInit<br />
    <h2>Description</h2>
        The jspInit() function is invoked by the container before any requests are serviced and
        is only performed once. It is mostly used as a way to initialize 
        resources/configurations for the servlet. For example: opening files, establishing
        a database connection, connecting to a network.<br />
    <h2>Syntax</h2>
        <pre>
        <b>public void</b> jspInit() {
        	// Initialization code
        }
        </pre><br />
